<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>I really enjoyed the detail that as the film progressed and The Narrator started to lose himself more and more Tyler starts to "glitch" or his image becomes blurry. This detail made me confused at first because I thought that my computer was lagging but it made sense to me by the end of the film and this simple detail helped in the long run. Overall this is an outstanding film. I like how throughout the film both The Narrator and the audience are unaware of anything and it's not until the end of the film that we are enlightened on what exactly it is that has been happening the entire time. I enjoyed the major plot twist at the end of the film and can say that it was my favourited part. The character's monotonous voice and deep eye bags really add to the film. The way that Tyler seemed so real to both the audience and the Narrator is also a great detail. It's a classic. The movie is mostly confusing up until the last 1/3 of the movie. It has a great plot-twist, specially considering how early this movie was written. Definitely a must see.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Time & space , these are two very important phenomrnon which kept humanity think for thousand of years  about this vast infinite universe and to find out its unapproachable interstellar destinations like solar system ,  milkyway , planets , blackholes ,etc. Highly talented great film maker Christopher  nolan has shown his  top class directorial skills by this great Sci fi saga " Interstellar"  .

From script to screenplay , cinematography  ,original score , editing , visual effects , performances , direction everything is 5/5.</p>
